# CS2043-Project

## Project Overview

### University Registration Management System 
The goal of this project is to create a university registration system which can be used by both professors and students. The system revolves around course registration.
<br>
Courses and new students will be added to the system by the program administrators. This allows for minimal discrepancies and a complete listing to be available.
<br>
Student will be able to see the course offerings available to them in the current and upcoming semesters to allow them to complete their registration. Five courses can be selected, along with waiting lists if some of their initial choices become filled (10  students maximum). Other courses may be cancelled if registration number fall below the minimum amount allowed (less than 3 students). A grace period is set each semester to allow students to access the system and change their schedules by adding or dropping courses after the semester has started.
<br>
Once a student completes their registration, their tuition gets updated within their profile. Students can request to see the billing total for their semester. This can change depending on if students decide to change their schedule. Changes made during the above-mentioned grace period will be billed accordingly, including full refunds.
<br>
Professor are also able to access the system in order to see which classes they will be teaching, along with the current class list of these courses. The administrator of the program will be tasked to assign the professors to the appropriate courses at a maximum of 2 classes per professor.
<br>
This program facilitates preparations for the semester and makes sure students and professors alike feel ready to jump into the next session.
