# CS2043-Project

## Project Overview

### University Registration Management System 
<br>
The goal of this project is to create a university registration system which can be used by both professors and students. The system revolves around course registration and works along with a billing system to keep track of tuition dues for a given semester.  
<br><br>
Courses will be added to the system by the program administrators. This allows for minimal discrepancies and a complete listing to be available. 
<br><br>
Student will be able to see the course offerings available to them in the upcoming semester and complete their registration. Four courses can be selected, along with two alternative choices if some of their initial choices become unavailable due to either low registration numbers (less than 3 students enrolled) or if the course is filled (10 student maximum). A grace period is set each semester to allow students to access the system and change their schedules by adding or dropping courses after the semester has started.
<br><br>
Once a student completes their registration, the information is sent to a billing system. Students can request to see the billing total for their semester. This can change depending on if students decide to change their schedule. Changes made during the above mentioned grace period will be billed accordingly, including full refunds. No penalties or partial refunds result from these changes.
<br><br>
Professor are also able to access the system in order to see which classes they will be teaching, along with which students are registered to their courses. The administrator of the program will be tasked to assign the professors to the appropriate courses. 
<br><br>
This program facilitates preparations for the semester and makes sure students and professors alike feel ready to jump into the next session.
